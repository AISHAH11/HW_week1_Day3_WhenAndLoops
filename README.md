# Instructions üìã

## Part I - Practice with when
---
### Write when statment statement takes an integer from the user representing a month (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) and calculates the number of days in all the months.

Output:
```
Enter the number of the month:
2
*****************
February has 28 days
*****************
```
```
Enter the number of the month:
1
*****************
January has 31 days
*****************
```

## Part II - Practice with Loops and arrays
---
#### a. Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then print the multiplication table of that number. 
Output:
```
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
5 * 4 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
5 * 6 = 30
5 * 7 = 35
5 * 8 = 40
5 * 9 = 45
5 * 10 = 50
```

#### b. Write a program that prints how many elements that are odd numbers in array of integers
Output:
```
[28,3,6,5,7,8,9]
There are 4 odds numbers in the array
```




## Part III - Challenges (Optional)
--- 

#### a. Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number with the digits reversed. For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 54321.

#### b. Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end it should display the count of positive, negative and zeros entered.
